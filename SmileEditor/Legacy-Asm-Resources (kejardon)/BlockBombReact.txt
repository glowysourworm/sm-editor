9D59: CLC and RTS
9E55: Load the BTS into A. If positive, multiply by 2 and use as an index for 94:9EA6,X to make a PLM. Clear V, SEC and RTS
9411: Load the BTS into A. If 0, CLC and RTS. Else use it as a horizontal tile offset to use a different tile for the jump index.
9FD6: Load the BTS into A. If positive, multiply by 2 and use as an index for 94:A012,X to make a PLM. Clear V, SEC and RTS
9D5B: SEC and RTS
9D71: Load the BTS into A. If negative, AND with #$007F and use to find a region-indexed PLM (94:9DC4 + Region * 10 + BTS * 2). If positive, use as an index for 94:9DA4,X to make a PLM. Either way, clear V, SEC, and RTS.
9E73: Load the BTS into A. If negative, AND with #$007F and use to find a region-indexed PLM (94:9F46 + Region * 10 + BTS * 2). If positive, use as an index for 94:9EA6,X to make a PLM. Either way, clear V, SEC, and RTS.
9447: Load the BTS into A. If 0, CLC and RTS. Else use it as a vertical tile offset to use a different tile for the jump index.
9FF4: Load the BTS into A. If positive, multiply by 2 and use as an index for 94:A012,X to make a PLM. Clear V, SEC and RTS
