	JSL $82BE17  ;  $13E17 IN ROM. Plays 'sounds' (80:9049, 90CB, 914D), actually stops all sounds.
	JSR $8143  ;  $28143 IN ROM. Layer 3 message box setup?
	JSR $81F3  ;  $281F3 IN ROM. Layer 3 clearing above and below message box
	JSR $8241  ;  $28241 IN ROM. Two subroutines depending on $1C1F. I'm guessing tiles and length, in that order.
	JSR $8574  ;  $28574 IN ROM. Adds a 2 frame delay, if I understand this right.
	JSR $844C  ;  $2844C IN ROM. 'Opens' the message box. This takes up several frames, during which nothing else runs.
	LDA $1C1F

	JSR $846D  ;  $2846D IN ROM. Code for while message box is open. Nothing else happens during this. (Wait for X time than any button usually, or wait for A or left/right/select on save)
	JSR $8589  ;  $28589 IN ROM. 'Closes' the message box. Takes several frames, nothing else happens.
	JSR $81F3  ;  $281F3 IN ROM. Layer 3 clearing, again
	JSR $861A  ;  $2861A IN ROM. Layer 3 message box cleanup.
	JSL $82BE2F  ;  $13E2F IN ROM. Resume speed boost and charge beam sounds, if necessary, and a few other sounds I'm unsure of.
	JSR $8574  ;  $28574 IN ROM. Another 2 frame pause.
	JSR $80FA  ;  $280FA IN ROM. If map station, go to pause screen. Else if 1C (ship save?) or 17 (save station save), LDA $05F9 (selected option)
