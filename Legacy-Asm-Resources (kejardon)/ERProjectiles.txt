Enemy/Room Projectile data (Bank 86)
Projectile headers look like they're E bytes each

Draygon's gunk (8E50):

Kago's bugs (D02E):
88 D0  EB D0  7D 9C  04 04  14 00  00 00  64 D0

Bytes 0-1: Initialization code
Bytes 2-3: Pointer of first AI to run (Run once every frame before any other part of the projectile)
Bytes 4-5: Pointer of first graphic AI to run (Same as PLM format and enemy graphic AI)
Byte    6: X 'radius' (1/2 width) of hit box
Byte    7: Y 'radius' (1/2 height) of hit box
Bytes 8-9: 8000 = Check for collisions with Samus's projectiles, 4000 = DON'T die on collision with Samus, 2000 = Disable collision with Samus, 1000 = Invisible. 0XXX = Damage to Samus
Bytes A-B: Pointer to new graphic AI on hit contact.
Bytes C-D: Pointer to new graphic AI on Samus's projectile contact. (Only for normal collisions - 7EF380,X = 0000)
