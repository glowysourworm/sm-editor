Smile Editor Legacy (CODE ONLY)
-------------------------------

VB Script is out-of-date. This project was to salvage the Visual Studio project that was the original
creation of the legacy editor.

The SMILE editor will not compile here; but the code may as a means to navigate while reverse engineering
it.

bas-files:  (Un-modified) basic (VBA) files from the legacy code
cls-files:  (Un-modified) class files from the legacy code
cpp-files:  (Un-modified) cpp file from the legacy code
frm-files:  (Un-modified) form files from the legacy code

Parsed:  Types and routines pulled from the VB code and orgnaized into small pieces. These have probably all
		 been worked on and imported into the SMEditor C# project
